# Disk configuration

# Below you will see examples of how to use the provided default partitioning schemes.
# Generally these should be sufficient for most system setups.
#
# You can also create your own scheme using the functions provided in scripts/config.sh,
# if you need something tailored to your specific system. Generally supported is
# any combination of RAID0/1, luks, zfs, btrfs and the usual filesystems (ext4, fat)
# Have a look at the implementation of the default schemes, but be aware that you
# most likely don't want to implement your own scheme.
#
# Be sure to only define one layout!

# This function will be called when a custom zfs pool type has been chosen.
# You do not need to change this, unless you have chosen a custom zfs pool type.
# $1: a string describing all device paths (for error messages)
# $@: device paths
function format_zfs_custom() {
	# See format_zfs_standard() function in scripts/functions.sh for an example!
	die "You need to implement format_zfs_custom() in your .conf file!"
}

function disk_configuration() {
	create_classic_single_disk_layout swap=8GiB type=efi luks=true root_fs=ext4 /dev/sdX

	# 1. create_classic_single_disk_layout
	#
	# This layout creates the most common partitioning scheme on a single disk, i.e.
	# one boot, one swap and one root partition. Swap can be disabled and the root
	# partition can be luks encrypted. This is probably the layout you are most familiar with.
	#
	# Parameters:
	#   swap=<size>           Create a swap partition with given size, or no swap
	#                         at all if set to false.
	#   type=[efi|bios]       Selects the boot type. Defaults to efi if not given.
	#   luks=[true|false]     Encrypt root partition. Defaults to false if not given.
	#   root_fs=[ext4|btrfs]  Root filesystem. Defaults to ext4 if not given.
	#create_classic_single_disk_layout swap=8GiB type=efi luks=true root_fs=ext4 /dev/sdX

	# 2. create_zfs_centric_layout
	#
	# A modern disk layout designed around ZFS. This layout is the same as the
	# single_disk_layout, but uses ZFS as the root filesystem and optionally allows
	# you to put additional disks into the zfs pool (with striping or mirroring).
	# Only the first disk will have boot and swap partitions, the other disks will
	# directly be added to the zfs pool. It is also possible to use ZFS's native
	# encryption feature to encrypt the pool.
	#
	# Parameters:
	#   swap=<size>                     Create a swap partition with given size, or no swap
	#                                   at all if set to false.
	#   type=[efi|bios]                 Selects the boot type. Defaults to efi if not given.
	#   encrypt=[true|false]            Encrypt the zfs datasets. Defaults to false if not given.
	#   compress=[false|<compression>]  Compress the zfs datasets. For valid values visit man zfsprops. Defaults to false if not given.
	#   pool_type=[standard|custom]     Select zfs pool type. Custom pools allow you to do the pool creation yourself. Defaults to standard.
	#create_zfs_centric_layout type=efi swap=8GiB encrypt=true compress=zstd pool_type=standard

	# 3. create_raid0_luks_layout
	#
	# This layout creates the single disk layout on multiple disks and combines
	# the swap and root partitions in separate RAID0 arrays. Useful if you e.g. have
	# several nvme drives and want increased speed. Only one boot partition will actually
	# be used though.
	#
	# Parameters:
	#   swap=<size>           Create a swap partition with given size for each disk,
	#                         or no swap at all if set to false.
	#   type=[efi|bios]       Selects the boot type. Defaults to efi if not given.
	#   luks=[true|false]     Encrypt root partition. Defaults to true if not given.
	#   root_fs=[ext4|btrfs]  Root filesystem. Defaults to ext4 if not given.
	# Careful: You will get N times the swap amount, so be sure to divide beforehand.
	#create_raid0_luks_layout swap=4GiB type=efi root_fs=ext4 /dev/sd{X,Y}

	# 4. create_raid1_luks_layout
	#
	# This layout creates the single disk layout on multiple disks and combines
	# the boot, swap, and root partitions in separate RAID1 arrays. Useful if you e.g. have
	# several nvme drives and want data redundancy. Each drive will have the boot partition mirrored.
	# If one drive fails, the system can still boot from another drive in the array.
	#
	# Parameters:
	#   swap=<size>           Create a swap partition with given size for each disk,
	#                         or no swap at all if set to false.
	#   type=[efi|bios]       Selects the boot type. Defaults to efi if not given.
	#   luks=[true|false]     Encrypt root partition. Defaults to true if not given.
	#   root_fs=[ext4|btrfs]  Root filesystem. Defaults to ext4 if not given.
	# Careful: You will get N times the swap amount, so be sure to divide beforehand.
	#create_raid1_luks_layout swap=4GiB type=efi root_fs=ext4 /dev/sd{X,Y}

	# 5. create_btrfs_centric_layout
	#
	# This layout is the same as the single_disk_layout, but uses btrfs as the root
	# filesystem and allows you to put additional disks into the btrfs device pool.
	# Only the first disk will have boot and swap partitions, the other disks will
	# directly be used in the btrfs device pool. If encryption is enabled, all disks
	# must be encrypted separately, as btrfs doesn't support encryption itself.
	# Also works with a single device.
	#
	# Parameters:
	#   swap=<size>              Create a swap partition with given size, or no swap
	#                            at all if set to false.
	#   type=[efi|bios]          Selects the boot type. Defaults to efi if not given.
	#   luks=[true|false]        Encrypt root partition and btrfs devices. Defaults
	#                            to false if not given.
	#   raid_type=[raid0|raid1]  Select raid type. Defaults to raid0.
	#create_btrfs_centric_layout swap=8GiB luks=false raid_type=raid0 /dev/sd{X,Y}
	#create_btrfs_centric_layout swap=8GiB luks=true /dev/sdX

################################################
# LUKS/ZFS encryption configuration

# If you have selected a disk layout that uses encryption with LUKS or ZFS,
# you need to define an encryption key. If you have not used an encrypted
# layout, you can skip this section.
#
# ######## Example: Password
#
# If you want a standard password, simply export it to the variable $GENTOO_INSTALL_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
# or echo it in the function below.
#   1. export GENTOO_INSTALL_ENCRYPTION_KEY="my strong passphrase"
#   2. OR: Adjust the function below to return the key: echo "my strong passphrase"
#
# ATTENTION: DO NOT INCLUDE A NEWLINE IN YOUR PASSWORD! Use a longer passphrase instead.
# It will save you a lot of trouble, because most software doesn't support reading passwords
# with newlines from stdin.
#
# By default, the selected KEYMAP will also be applied in the initramfs.
# If you want to be safe, use a long passphrase with standard alphanumeric characters,
# so that you can type it without your selected keymap on the default english layout.
#
# ######## Example: Keyfile
#
# If you want to generate a strong password and use it as a keyfile,
# you will have to do the necessary adjustments to the initramfs yourself.
# Begin setup with a temporary passphrase and replace it later with a keyfile.
#
# Generate a strong keyfile from /dev/urandom. I would suggest piping
# it into base64 afterwards, to avoid problems with special characters in different
# initramfs implementations and to allow manual typing for rescue purposes.
#
# Be aware that the initramfs generated by this script will always ask for a user
# supplied passphrase. If you want to use the keyfile on a USB stick or want an
# even more advanced setup, you will have to make these modifications yourself.
# This basically means adjusting the initramfs cmdline, which you can do here with
# the following statement:
#   DISK_DRACUT_CMDLINE+=("rd.luks.keyfile=whatever")
#
# You can also adjust the boot entry manually after the installation is complete,
# as you can always use the keyfile in a live system. This might be easier if you
# are currently not sure what options you need exactly.
#
# To generate a strong keyfile, follow this procedure:
#
#   1. Generating a strong keyfile with (resulting file must be < 8MiB)
#      `head -c1024 /dev/urandom | base64 -w0 > /path/to/keyfile`
#   2. Now remember the path and also copy the keyfile somewhere safe so you can
#      unlock your machine later.
#   3. Enter path to keyfile in the function below
#
# ######## Example: GPG encrypted keyfile
#
# Same procedure as for the keyfile, but encrypt it after generation with gpg:
#   `cat /path/to/keyfile | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --output /my/permanent/storage/luks-key.gpg`
# Unfortunately, getting GPG to work properly in the initramfs
# isn't as easy, so it's currently not part of this script, but might be later.
# Feel free to experiment though.

# If you don't want to write your password to your disk, simply export it
# in your terminal before running ./install, like so:
#     `export GENTOO_INSTALL_ENCRYPTION_KEY="my strong passphrase"`
# You can also just set the variable here, but this is not recommended because
# depending on your current environment, this file might be stored on an actual disk,
# and so your password would be written to that disk at least once.
